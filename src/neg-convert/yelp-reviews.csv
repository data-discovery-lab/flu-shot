The location of this hotel and very decent price makes this an amazing deal. When you walk out the front door Scott Monument and Princes street are right in front of you, Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile is a 2 minute walk via a close right around the corner, and there are so many hidden gems nearby including Calton Hill and the newly opened Arches that made this location incredible.  The hotel itself was also very nice with a reasonably priced bar, very considerate staff, and small but comfortable rooms with excellent bathrooms and showers. Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free.  I would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation.",0,0,0DuffS87NaSMDmIfluvT83g,0xtbPEna2Kei11vsU-U2Mw,uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA,5,11/20/13,"gute lage im stadtzentrum. shoppingmeile und sehenswŸrdigkeiten, sowie gute pubs in laufweite. das hotel ist neu, gut gepflegt und hat bemŸhtes/nettes personal. ideal fŸr einen kurztrip nach edinburgh. lŠngere aufenthalte eher nicht, da die zimmer recht klein sind.",0,0,0GvLmUkjUrOyFH8KFnmT1uw,rW8q706dz5-NnXDzMwVkiw,uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA,5,6/5/16,"Erstklassige Lage.

I stayed at the Dusseldorf branch a while ago so when I saw one in Edinburgh, I knew this was the place to book. We managed to get a reservation during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and only booked a few weeks before. We did pay a premium over the normal rate but given the crowds in the city during this time, it was still a good deal compared to other hotels.  Staff were all friendly and welcoming, presentable and professional. We received a room upgrade with quite a large room overlooking the bridge crossing Waverley station to Princes St. Despite overlooking a busy road, the room was almost silent thanks to solid double glazing. The room temperature was perfectly controlled with an individual A/C unit. Super clean, modern, uncluttered. Bathroom was similar. No slamming doors or noise in the night. Bonus.  Free wifi that works with one log in (doesn't require repeated log ins as some places do) and had decent signal strength.  The buffet continental breakfast was also a hit with fresh croissants, danishes, cold cuts, cheese, toast, fruit and yoghurt all well presented, fresh and good quality as was the coffee.

I took advantage of the Telus Taste of Tuesday promotion in which you get a free appetizer and dessert with the purchase of an entrŽe. To top it off, parking was free at this part of town after 6 pm on weekdays.   My boyfriend had the potato and bacon soup. I had two delicious spoonfuls of the soup. I enjoyed chewing on the bits of bacon, which added a delectable smokiness to the creamy soup.   I ordered the appetizer special of the day - chicken liver parfait. I absolutely loved this! The liver spread was delightfully creamy and I loved that intense flavour of the liver, complemented by a dab of tangy Dijon mustard.  Steak Frites - 8oz thick cut top sirloin, served with lemon mayo - was executed to perfection. The steak was juicy, flavourful and amazingly tender. I really enjoyed the meat, but what stood out the most for me was the lemon mayo, which was, in one word, addictive. I wanted to eat it all right off a spoon.   I had the striped bass, served over sweet onion purŽe and tartar garnish, with beer battered sweet dumpling squash and hen of the woods mushroom. I enjoyed all the components on the plate, and everything worked well together. The fish was perfectly cooked and the skin was nice and crispy. I wiped my whole plate clean and wanted more.   For dessert, our first choice was the maple panna cotta, topped with candied bacon strips. The bacon's saltiness really brought out the sweetness of the panna cotta and also provided a great crunch. The panna cotta, which came out resembling a block of tofu, was creamy and satisfying.  Our other dessert choice was the honey and pistachio tart with crme anglaise. I loved that there was a generous amount of nuts in every bite. I wished the pistachio could be a little more toasted and crunchier, but the tart was, nevertheless, delicious.

The atmosphere there is rather romantic, with candlelight and a somewhat dark setting. It's not a very large restaurant, but the small space doesn't make it too loud.  The menu we had was prix fixe with an appetizer, entrŽe, and dessert. Since there were two of us, we were able to try a good portion of the menu, and we were rather impressed with what we got. My pork belly entree was very tasty and light.  My partner had the steak frites for entrŽe, and I while normally tend to stay away from steaks at a non-steakhouse (because you never know what you're going to get), this steak was tender, charred, and very well-executed.

That was my mentality before I moved into Acacia and I am SO GLAD that I live here!! It is amazing!   Between four years of college and four years of post college, I have lived in approximately 8 apt complexes in 3 states and Acacia Creek is the BEST overall!!! First and foremost, the staff and maintenance are just absolutely outstanding. If you have a request, they will tend to it immediately. They remember your name and call just to touch base and make sure things are okay. They are very respectful of your privacy and the grounds always stay clean and maintained. The complex is fairly quiet... and I don't even see my neighbors very often but it seems like more professional couples, young adults and singles... though there are some families with young children as well. There are 3 pools, and 1 is heated, a decent sized gym and lots of uncovered parking. (and a recycling bin!!!)   The location is great! It's just South of Scottsdale and Shea, on Gold Dust Avenue. Lots of things within walking distance grocery stores (Fresh and Easy, Safeway), bars and restaurants (Baja Bar, Eddies, Chop and Wok, Indulge Burger, Dennys, Oregenos), and two pharmacies. It's about 10 minutes to Old Town and Kierland Commons, approx 5-7 minutes to the 51 and 5-7 minutes to the 101.   The apts are nice. We live in a 2 bdrm/ 2 bath corner unit on the 2nd floor (top floor) with a fireplace and a HUGE patio (approx 7x15!). It has a nice skylight and an entire wall of windows. One design flaw I noticed is that there's only one AC vent in the living room area, while there are 3 in the master bedroom which is half the size. It does take a long time for the living room to cool down on the hot days (esp being a top floor, corner unit with lots of exposure to the afternoon sun). But the walls are 2 toned with a nice beige accent wall in every room, including the bathrooms. The master has a large walk in closet and lots of storage. There is also a full sized washer and dryer.

The ambience is great for doing your own thing, but I've also played board games there.  They have all kinds of teas there. They have specials every day in each variety, and they give you a pot of it, which is around 2-3 cups. You can also order a pot of any loose leaf tea on the menu. Or, you can buy loose leaf tea as well. My all-time favorite is the Panetonne. It's a black tea with vanilla and orange, and just the right amount of it too. I also really like their Green Tea smoothie, they make it with Maccha powder. They make grilled cheese sandwiches and have some biscottis and muffins.

First look:   The whole place has a very cool, very inviting vibe.  The decor (industrial, rustic wood mixed with some seriously cool and unique art) hangout areas (sweet beer garden), lighting that makes everyone look pretty/handsome (with or without beer goggles) and a window looking into the brewery operation.  These features make it a really special place.  Even the restrooms are rad. It looks like a lot of love went into every detail.  The Beer: This is a true tasting room.  I equate it to going to your favorite wine tasting room and enjoying the various types of wine, except it's delicious beer (obviously). (e.g.; the Nines, you gotta try the Nines!). What it is not is a pub or a sports bar with super loud people, Budweiser and NFL whistles blowing from 50 TV screens...which is refreshing.  I feel a person just starting to develop their beer palette would feel right at home bellying up to the bar along side a person with a honed, mature beer palette. It's a place to try and sample what suits your beerbuds best.  With tons of amazing beer options that have awesome names you know have a story behind them, you can't go wrong.  My husband tried the coffee brown ale and he loved it! Oh, and it looks like they offer special ""reserve"" and yummy flavored type brews each week as well.  Best to check out their Insta and Facebook pages for weekly beer offering updates.  The staff: Great staff,  knowledgeable, welcoming, efficient and accommodating.  Eager to make you feel right at home.  The food: I've eaten many burgers in my life, let me tell you.  Had the most delicious. burger. ever from the onsite food truck.  I think they are called, Fire and Forged.  Like the Shop, the food truck folks took great care to give me their best.  Quality beef cooked to medium rare perfection. Homemade pickles (homemade pickles people! Who does that!?!).  Real/non-iceberg lettuce.  Some seriously special sauce, too.  Paired wonderfully with the Nines! (See what I did there? )  Overall: Great night out with the Mr. Even bought a couple super softy shirts and of course bought a few cans of the Nines to take home to CA.  Do yourself (and your mouth) a favor and get over to the Shop.  They are doing some seriously good work there.

They really have the small-neighborhood-brewery thing down pat. I had the pleasure of chatting with one of the brewers, Andy, at the Strong Beer Festival while sampling their limited edition releases specifically for said event. The beers I tried there were AMAZING! One was the FYITM another was a special FYITM [i think a fruity version], and something else I can't recall.   A week or so after, I host a Sunday Funday at The Shop for a large group of friends and luckily remembered to tell Andy about it at the Festival. He and his team were gracious enough to reserve space for our group. The weather didn't want to cooperate that Sunday but when I arrived it was fairly dead inside so I pushed together large floor tables in the corner with no problems. Andy did such a great job going over the beer list many times as people came in at varied times as well as keeping track of what we ordered and making sure the glasses did not run dry. I definitely recommend doing the flight - it's $8 for 4 samples which can be a mix from The Shop and/or some from their guest beers.

We had two rolls, one eel and avocado and another tuna, avocado and some other stuff - both were fantastic. After seeing someone else with it, we also ordered the calamari with slaw and chili paste and, by far the best dish of the evening, the black miso seared cod. I've been remembering that cod all weekend, it was so good. There were a lot of other things on the menu that I wanted to try as well. Maybe another time.  Actually, everything was really, really good. This was a place I would want to revisit if I lived in Madison. Although we didn't order anything off it, they did have a specials menu with at least three items, and the very extensive sake menu.   Contrary to what one of the other reviewers said, I think it would be really hard for the average person to spend $100 alone unless you just stuffed yourself silly. We ordered five dishes total and two small bottles of sparking sake to share among three women and the bill was $85. Actually I couldn't quite believe how reasonable the bill was when it came.   BTW, make reservations. We weren't in a hurry, so we went and had a drink and came back, but the dining area is quite small, so if you have more than two people you'll definitely want to call ahead on a weekend evening.",2,0,0FhVvlurmgtZy6kkQO2xfEg,#NAME?,AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg,5,9/1/06,"Muramoto is a paradise if you are a sake lover.

I adore places that encourage tapas style/family dining and Muramoto's portions are what some may describe as small.  (Two to share two entrees is just enough food.) Additionally I appreciate that food is brought out as it is done being prepared and does not suffer death under a heat lamp. For drinks I had Lychee Liquor and grapefruit juice which was mango-ey and so tasty. I'd consider coming back just for that concoction alone.  We ordered the Tuna with Wasabi Flying Roe, Shrimp in Spicy Coconut Sauce, and the Pan Seared Scallop. (which was the favorite dish)  All of our food embodied unique flavors, and were demonstrations of  ""Asian fusion"" done right.  Our server was incredibly helpful with questions, and prompt without seeming as if she was trying to rush us out the door.   Also prices were not that bad.  For 2 entrees, 1 roll, and drinks we exited the restaurant only about $60-ish poorer (including tip). I am definitely returning.

All info I've seen says 'tapas style', but I will tell you - these plates are not too small, and quite filling. Their other spot cross town is an incredible sushi restaurant with everything under the sun. Here, only have a few rolls on the menu (and they are incredible), but that is not why you come. Come for the tasty, hot dishes, and for the sake flights.  Every so often, you eat a meal that is soooo good, so perfect in almost every way, and the tastes are so unforgettable, that you want to get right up then and there, and do what I affectionately call, The Food Dance. This is food that makes your eyes roll back into your head with every bite, and leaves you wondering where the hell you have been eating all these years. This was, hands down, my saving grace in Madison. Presentation of the food is spectacular. Eating alone? Sit at the bar and stare at um-teen bottles of Japanese sake. Eating with a group? Even better, as the sushi rolls they do have there (soft-shell crab or avocado and mango roll w/ thin-sliced duck breast on top, drizzled with a duck reduction sauce, or a few others) are HUGE. Don't think California sushi, as each roll which costs $10 has about ten large slices, and you will find it hard to eat an entire one by yourself. These rolls would easily be double the price if this was in SF.  Look for Michael, the tall, bald-shaven, server/barman that knows everything about the menu, and can recommend many good sakes on the list. Try the sake flight (3 glasses) for a nice accompaniment to any meal. Now for the best part........you want small slices of some of the tastiest beef anywhere? Get the hangar steak. Not a large portion (meaning not a whole steak) but you get several slices of this beef, drizzled with a white miso-bleu cheese sauce that is to DIE FOR. Not a fan of bleu cheese? No worries, as the taste is made subtle by the combining with miso. But please, do yourself a favor - ORDER THIS DISH! Not a big beef fan? That's fine, as the Grilled Miso Black Cod is their signature dish. My suggestion? Start with some sake, and order yourself one sushi roll, and one hot dish. Take a few people, and everyone order a few different things, and share. And won't you be happy when you get out of there, after all this tasty food, and still you are not over the per diem. And if you are, maybe you shouldn't have had that third drink. Be advised - this place has a little wooden sign in the window, and it took me forever to find it.

I enjoy the fact that they serve their edamame with big grains of salt to give it an extra kick.

I end my Valentine to Muramoto with a shout out to its modern decor that made me feel like I was in big city again, and that it smells like fresh sushi on the inside, since most Japanese restaurants don't smell like anything!

On to the main courses- started with the tuna/mayo roll. This was a quite a big portion and really was a great sushi roll for those that like the bells and whistles. The hangar steak was tasty. The bleu cheese sauce was just perfect and made the steak that much better. Could have used just a tad more crust on the meat. Finally, we had the miso black cod. This is how fish should taste.

Sesame Crusted Big Eye Tuna with tahini sauce - I love it!  The sauce is so nutty and tasty and goes perfectly with the tuna and mixed greens.  Rock Crab Croquettes - it's their version of crab cakes but they deep fry the croquettes (4) and they arrive at your table piping hot.  They're delicious! - reminds me of my beloved dungeness crabs back home.     Shrimp and Spicy Coconut Sauce with crushed peanuts - this is pretty good.  It's very similar to Thai food.  Hangar Steak with bean salad in bleu cheese & miso dressing - both times I've had it it's been a little tough and very chewy.  The bean salad (scattered around the steak on a long rectangular plate) drenched in the dressing is quite good.  DESSERTS We ordered the Sample Platter.  I'm glad we did because we were able to try some really interesting desserts.  This Platter is perfect for two people.  Yuzu (Japanese Citrus Fruit) Panna Cotta - a little more firm than normal panna cotta.  Didn't really taste the citrusy fruit.  But it was very good.  It kind of reminded me of a smoother version of cheesecake without the graham cracker crust.  It also had a drizzle of some berry compote.  Strawberry Spring Roll w/Honey ginger ice cream - I really liked the spring roll.  It was nice and hot and I think there was some sweetened sticky rice in it as well.  I'm a big fan of ginger but for some reason I didn't like the ice cream.  Honey Black Sesame Creme Brulee - this was not my favorite but it was interesting.  The creme wasn't super creamy but had a little texture to it.  The color of the creme was a dark charcoal grey and tasted like smokey sesame.  It's a clever idea but not something I would try again.  Kabocha (Japanese pumpkin/squash) Cheesecake - pumpkiny cheesecake with cinnamon or nutmeg with maple syrup lining the plate was my favorite.,0,0,0GvvwtTL0KEqO9l8qNIgQ9w,5Kbn1FjXmS7Jypz3_ybt_Q,AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg,5,10/22/06,"I will never look at sushi the same way again!

We chose three businesses on the west side of town to start with.  Elite A/V was the only business that could be bothered to qualify us as customers and after about an hour of talking A/V with Carmine and Jeremy we had three quotes THAT DAY!  I needed to convert my old ""tube"" TV niche so I could hang the plasma on the wall.  During this remodel project Elite A/V sent a team out to pull some new wired networking runs and they were able to complete this task in one day.  A couple of return visits to patch up the holes and you can't tell they were ever here!  The price was very reasonable and the job was finished quickly (much quicker than I expected) and professionally.  We had asked Carmine to give us three quotes and a budget cap to work with and when Carmine told us we would have quotes same day I originally thought that was a bit optimistic since we met with them later in the afternoon...but sure enough after dinner I had quotes in my inbox.  This is the kind of service we received from Elite A/V over and over, when they said they were going to do something they did it and always on time.  We decided to go with Martin Logan Eloctrostats and a Marantz receiver to replace our aging equipment and I will say it is impressive, the warmth, depth, and clarity is hard to imagine until you hear it.  This was an A++ purchase at a reasonable price and we are one hundred percent satisfied.  We are looking forward to our continued relationship with Elite A/V as their customer service and quality of service was unmatched by others we talked to during our remodel project.

Him and an associate of his stopped by on the date we agreed on (on time) and knocked my whole home theater system out in less than 5 hours.

They replied back to me within minutes saying it would probably be around $99.00 which I found acceptable and scheduled an appointment for the next day.  They arrived on time and explained that because the home theater system was so old they could not connect the new blue ray to it but could only connect it to the TV.   Since that was not a good option for me I declined and they were kind enough to not charge me for the service call.   I then thought about purchasing another home theater system but they suggested that I use the existing built in ceiling speakers.  I had originally not wanted to spend what I thought would be a lot of money to hook those up but after further discussions with Dylan I agreed this was the best route.   He was able to provide a receiver and sub-woofer for me or I could have went out and purchased my own.  I verified based on his quote and the cost was no more than what I would have paid at Best Buy.   We rescheduled for the next day for the install and again they were right on time.  Kevin and his partner came out and completed the installation in about 2  1/2 hours talking us through the whole process.  They had to cut a small hole in the back of the entertainment center so they could attach the wires which I was at first not crazy about but it was very small and behind a closed door so it was a non-issue.

They are personable, professional and make you feel at ease - whether you buy gear from them or have your own, you can be assured that they will treat you the same and give you top notch advice on both integration and installation.

Having lived in New Orleans for some time, I was both curious and eager to give HSW a try. (New Orleans is famous for some of its fried/comfort foods.)  The Bottom Line: this place is rather magical. If you love fried food that is slathered in hot sauce, then this is your place. To be honest, the fried food offers a one-dimensional taste experience; however, the food presentation is beautiful...in an ordered-chaos sort of way.  There's a menu, but you pretty much just get whatever they have available (I.e., whatever is sitting in the warmers behind the counter). I tried the fried chicken and the famous Polish Boy sandwich -- a fried kielbasa topped with coleslaw, fries, and hot sauce. I also ""sauced"" everything, allowing the kind worker to paint all of my food with the ever-so-sweet-tangy-and-delicious HSW hot sauce. The food was hot, and amazingly, the chicken was as crispy/tasty as some of the famous fried chicken of New Orleans' Willie Mae's Scotch House and Dooky Chase. (Huge success!)  The decor is the best part of HSW. The restaurant is appears to be a bit rundown, ostensibly dirty, and some of the windows are adorned with iron bars/mesh for safety purposes.

So, gents, let me explain why this is actually happening and to have a successful / fun / enjoyable afternoon with your lady in Las Vegas.   Step 1: Regardless of where you're staying, suggest to them ""Today I think we should stop by one of the casino bars after breakfast and have some champagne. Then we'll game for a half hour or so after which we'll walk through the Palazzo and do some shopping"" - at which point she'll agree because you said the magic word: SHOPPING!  Step 2: Enact the plan - head down to the casino bar and ply her with mimosas or bellinis or whatever...so long as it has champagne in it, you're golden. Have a couple yourself. Gamble. Casually announce that you're off to do some shopping.  Step 3: Amble your way along to the Palazzo - if you come in through the front then walk through the casino, stop at a gelato shop, etc. Make it enjoyable.   Step 4: Upon arriving at the Palazzo your jaw will drop (yes, even you, lowly non shopping gents) at the staggering displays therein. And so will your lovely lady's jaw drop. Stop at a couple stores and then announce that you need a refill.   Step 5: Stop at the Double Helix Wine Bar and collect glasses of wine for your and your date / significant other.  Step 6: Tag along while they shop. You're now pleasantly buzzed and you'll find you don't hate it.   Step 7: While shopping you'll invariably find something that (a) costs a little less than what she was expecting and (b) costs a bit more than what you were expecting. BUY IT.   Step 8: The remainder of your trip to Vegas will be the best time of your life and you can pretty much do anything.

Wir sind schon šfter an dieser Pizzeria vorbeigegangen und ich habe Ÿber den Namen etwas die Nase gerŸmpft - Regenbogen, das klingt so nach schlechter 80er Jahre Taverne.  Drinnen ist es dann im ersten Eindruck auch ein bisschen, wie bei einer kleinen Zeitreise - allerdings nicht in die 80er, sondern in die 90er, in die mich gerade die Lampen und die Einrichtung zurŸckversetzten. Was ich aber sehr charmant fand, waren die Theaterfotografien an den WŠnden.  Beim Service war ich am Anfang etwas verunsichert, weil der gute Herr wirklich finster gucken konnte, aber das verbesserte sich im Laufe des Abends merklich und jeder, der an unseren Tisch kam war immer hšflich und professionell. Au§erdem waren GetrŠnke und Speisen immer unverzŸglich an unserem Tisch, auch als es spŠter am Abend sehr voll wurde - so lob ich mir das.  Das Essen war dann ein wahres Gedicht, angefangen beim Brotkorb mit frisch gebackenen Pizzabrštchen bis hin zur Nachspeise, was wieder zeigt, dass man sich nicht von €u§erlichkeiten abschrecken lassen darf.  Auf der gemischten Vorspeisenplatte fanden wir ein Gedicht an italienischer Salami und Schinken sowie exzellentem KŠse. Mein Bruschetta war ein frisch gebackener halber Pizzafladen mit frischen TomatenstŸckchen, die ordentlich mit Knoblauch garniert waren - sehr lecker! Die Hauptgerichte haben uns dann absolut Ÿberzeugt: Ich hatte frische Nudeln von der Tageskarte mit Steinpilzen. Die Nudeln waren einen winzigen Tacken zu al dente fŸr meinen Geschmack, aber sie zogen noch etwas nach. Die Steinpilze in der So§e mit frischen KrŠutern waren hervorragend.  Aber das absolute Highlight war die Pizza: wie in Italien. HauchdŸnner, geschmacklich hervorragender, knuspriger, aber nicht trockener Teig mit leckerem Mozzarella, der ordentlich FŠden zieht und frischem Belag, der die anderen Zutaten nicht erstickt. Ich bin sonst von Pizza nicht so leicht zu beeindrucken, aber diese war einfach ein Gedicht. Der Tiramisu zum Nachtisch musste dann noch sein, obwohl wir eigentlich schon satt waren. Er hat den hervorragenden Eindruck des Essens noch unterstrichen.  Auch der Wein war hervorragend und mit 4,50 Euro fŸr 1/4 Liter auch nicht besonders teuer. Insgesamt war das Preis-Leistung-VerhŠltnis (9 Euro fŸr die Pizza, 10,50 Euro fŸr die Nudeln) fŸr die QualitŠt absolut angebracht.

Ours was a party of four and had no time constraints so we decided to do a couple courses of splitting the small plates.  After our incredible waiter Joseph walked us through some of his favorite things and some of the background for some of the food, we chose our first course as Octopus salad, soft shell crab special, chilaquiles, shrimp and grits, and fried rice.  All of these dishes were as advertised and devoured by our party.  The octopus salad was some of the most tender, tasty octopus we have had anywhere in the country let alone Cleveland.

Our second course we chose soul bowl (mac and cheese with pork belly and collard greens), boudin and mash (blood sausage and mashed potatoes), confit wings, and the five cheese pizza.  While I don't like collard greens, the mac and cheese and huge pieces of pork belly was good.  The blood sausage and mashed potatoes were a british/irish delicacy and delight.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were great.  The confit wings were a bit salty but they literally fell off the bone and were served with a green sauce that I can't quite figure out what it was.  The pizza was great topped with tomato and basil and quite flavorful.  Our party had a couple bottles of wine from the extensive wine list and some of their cocktails (Sacre Bleu and French 75).  The cocktails were all made from scratch and delicious.  The staff at this restaurant were incredible with multiple people from servers, hosts, back kitchen staff, and managers all making their way to our table to wish one a Happy Birthday and welcome us to the restaurant.  The new hotel is beautiful inside.  Wish the Bar 32 (bar and patio on the 32nd floor) was open but its still not finished.

As an ovo-lacto vegetarian (I eat eggs and dairy products), I am never sure if somewhere that specializes in hot dogs will have any options for me, but RETRO Dog has not one but three vegetarian entrees--a veggie dog, a veggie Italian sausage, and a black bean burger. They also offer veggie chili, veggie coney sauce, and veggie cheese fries.  I had a veggie dog with veggie coney sauce and cole slaw and a side of onion rings. The dog had a pleasant texture and flavor and the toppings were scrumptious. I have tried quite a few veggie dogs in my day and this was definitely one of the best. The onion rings were unlike any other rings I have tried. The batter had an interesting flavor and was not crumbly like many other rings, but it was crisp and delicious. I also enjoyed the zesty sauce that accompanied the rings.  I chose the locally-brewed root beer for my beverage and I was not disappointed. The flavor was mellow and not overly sweet and it was served in a fancy chilled mug.   My dining companions ordered a veggie Italian sausage, a RETRO Dog, a Red Hot, and a couple other meat dogs and everyone was satisfied. We also happened to go on a buy one, get one free hot dog day, which was a pleasant surprise for the pocket book.   We chose to eat inside, rather than utilizing the Swenson's-style carports. They looked fine, if that's your thing. The atmosphere inside is a fun mix of retro kitsch and contemporary. The chairs are surprisingly comfortable and the service was efficient and friendly.

(Especially since I've never been to Europe so I have yet to see his most famous works...so far I have only been able to see only a handful of his original pieces).  The gallery is open until 8 pm, with last admission at 7:30 pm. We allowed ourselves a good hour to spend in the gallery. The tickets were reasonably priced: $11 for students, $16 for general adults. Though the gallery was small and comprised of about 4 rooms, there were probably at least 20 paintings on display.  We were told they were on loan from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. There is a complimentary audio tour but I personally declined the option, so I cannot give much feedback on that.  I was slightly disappointed that not all of the works were by Monet, though it was still nice to see some variety (other works included those by Boudin, Pissarro, and Corot).  They showcased a lovely selection of both famous and less-known Monet pieces. However, they did not have any water lilies or Japanese bridge, which I would have loved to see.

But I was pleasantly surprised (and most appreciative!!) that they did not reprimand me when I peered fairly closely at each painting (framed behind glass) to view the intricate textures and brushstrokes, which I have unfortunately experienced in the past at another museum.

He also brought us a basket of bread, though it almost wasn't necessary because our appetizer came quickly.

It was awesome - great mix of flavours and the pasta was cooked perfectly and served hot. I was skeptical about the hazelnuts at first but they were a great compliment to the gorgonzola. The portion was pretty big for this type of place, so my date had a bit of my pasta too and he also thought it was yum.  My date had the beef short ribs and said they were excellent and that the meat was falling off the bone. (As someone who does not eat beef or pork I was assured this was a good thing ha). It came with root vegetables and parsnip puree. Just as we were digging in our server brought a little bowl with extra root vegetables because the chef had suddenly realized my date didn't get enough. Once he pointed it out we realized there were only like 3 mini veggie cubes in his dish so it was nice that the staff noticed before we even did.   We contemplated getting dessert for a minute, but were pretty stuffed. Maybe next time I'd skip the appetizer and try a dessert.  Only main downfall was sitting at the bar, it's not the comfiest to sit on a stool and it felt a bit crowded when other patrons were seated at the bar. It was also a little chilly/breezy as it's near the door and it was cold out. But that was our own fault.  Not sure what the total bill was in the end for the 2 drinks, appetizer and two mains, but our mains were around $20-25, some on the menu were a little pricier.

The place was packed at about 1 pm on a saturday. But considering how tasty the food was, I was surprised how busy it was. I ordered a mimosa and the toritilla - a sort of spanish-style dish that takes eggs, potatoes, cheese and bakes it into some quiche-type thing. It was served with a fresh tomato dip and some greens and it was absolutely delicious. I also sampled my boyfriends cheese plater, toasts with a variety of cheese and fruit, and it was also very tasty.

The flavours of each is not very strong....like it didn't punch you in the face. The mushroom flavour was not very full. The lamb flavour was very slight. The one with the most flavour is the goat cheese ball. It really had to be elevated by the sauce at the side. I actually had no issue with that because I often find the gamey taste of lamb and goat distasteful. She on the other hand was slightly disappointed about the legendary hot balls from Table 17.   Diver Scallops: Diver Scallops with Roasted with fresh bay leaves, served with sauce bŽarnaise & guanciale I liked this dish. It was again on the heavier and saltier side. Everything plated works together harmoniously. The scallop balanced the bŽarnaise and the guanciale perfectly. The texture of the scallop is escalated by the crunchiness of the guanciale.   EntrŽe:  Haddock: Haddock with chanterelle mushroom, sprouts, truffled potato, radish Perhaps our expectations for fresh seafood is a little high. We both felt the haddock is lacking in freshness. Fresh fish tends to hold together better. The sprouts were supposed to reduce the heaviness of the dish but it just wasn't enough.   Dessert:  Lemon Panna Cotta with Blueberry compote.

Not that I don't enjoy spice, but there is a balance.  The duck rillette was really delightful, and I am generally not a huge duck fan. I'm not sure if that was orange zest or I imagined it in there, that's how subtle the flavors can be, but  I loved it. Especially the piquance of the pickled carrots with the toast and meat. Would have bought a quart of the pickles if we had room in our luggage.   The duck-fatted mash was bit too heavy for me that night, but my fiance had no trouble finishing it off.

The tables were a little bit close, but not intruding and the waiter was patient and informative with the questions I had (I always have questions!)  For our shared appie, we went with the Burrata because I have been looking for a good burrata dish since I moved back to TO and had not found it yet.- I tried one at Reds last year and thought that it was not creamy enough and unfortunately, this one missed the mark as well. I thought that there was not mixture between the mozza and cream, so the soft texture of the burrata was lacking. The flavours and other components of the dish paired very well.. just wish there was more creamy goodness.  It happened to be Good Friday and I really did not plan to eat meat that night. I was tempted to go with the shortribs because I knew I would not be disappointed from my first experience. I was debating between the pasta and one of the fish dishes but there was one component of each dish that did not speak to me.  On a whim, I went with the scallops at the very last second. It came in a creamy broth (was not a fan at first read) but it had been quite some time since I had some good scallops and I definitely had set some high expectations. On first bite..... I was grinning ear to ear... the scallops were perfectly cooked, loads of flavour in the broth, and I could not get enough. I'm just not a super big fan of clams, so I cannot really comment on them. None the less, I tried to scoop up ever last ounce of the broth on the plate! The short ribs were tender (husband's review), and very tasty.  For dessert .... I did not have to look at the menu - sticky toffee pudding it is.... it came out hot in a ramekin, loaded with caramel sauce and apple butter on the side. Rich, decadent, tasty, mouth watering..... it was just like I remembered and more! S had the banana cheesecake, which I was hesitant about because I'm not sure how that could go well together... but it was actually surprisingly subtle but evident in banana flavour.

The staff here has been friendly every time I've been.  They are always keen on offering suggestions if you ask!

Savory offerings include grilled cheeses, soups, and sometimes specials.  One small gripe I have is that their teapots tend to, for whatever reason or another, leak some tea leaves and residue when you pour into your cup.  I suspect it's because the filter is not super fine and so small bits from the tea mixture can fall through.  It's never been a major problem, though.

As a tea lover, having passed it many times on Murray, I'd long been curious about it. My friends who live nearby never wanted to go, however, since they prefer Dobra Tea across the street. Last week, CM wanted to get a hot beverage in the area, and he was game for checking it out, so I was able to do so.  When we went to order, the menu had loose leaf teas listed by type (columns) and by grade (rows), which determined their price.  While you can buy them by the cup, if you're with other people or you're planning on hanging out for awhile, it usually makes more sense to get a pot, since each pot provides 2-3 infusions, and hot water is free.  We decided on a pot of the milk (?) oolong ($4.50), recommended by the barista, which was on the lighter side and was quite pleasant.  Once we'd had a pot and refilled it with hot water for a second infusion, we also got a pesto grilled cheese sandwich with tomato as a snack ($4.75), which was crisp and super-flavorful (thanks for the recommendation, fellow Yelpers!), and complemented the tea well.  My favorite part of Te Cafe, however, was the board games that can be found on the back shelf and front table.  Unfortunately, not all of them are complete, as CM and I found out when we picked up the Ultimate Scenario Game (?), but those that are make for a fun time!  We ended up playing dominoes--which I'd never played with as a game before (just setting them up in rows and knocking them down ;-) ). Since the first two games went quickly, with each of us winning one, we played best out of three. The last game went on to the point I thought we were going to run out of dominoes, but I eventually won.  Yay!  While I understand my friends' preference for Dobra, given that they have a more extensive menu of tea and snacks and a more unique Asian tea house-like atmosphere, I enjoyed Te Cafe for a change of pace. I'd definitely return for another visit in the future to sample more interesting teas--and to play another round of dominoes!",14,8,10CBamcMDNj6fCU5JbkRFgfw,3ew6BEeK14K6x6Omt5gbig,MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg,4,5/1/17,"Came on a weekday afternoon to study and it was a good environment to do so.

IMO, the former more than makes up for the latter, which is at its worst just a bit slow and unconcerned.  (Once, for example, we were two dishes into our meal before our first round of drinks arrived.)  But, ahh, the food.  This is probably the most creative food in Madison.  I describe it as pan-asian fusion in a tapas form factor.  There is some sushi, and some is even pretty good (I'm thinking of the signature duck mango avocado rolls).  That said, it's a mistake to think of Muramoto as a sushi place, though (there is a Muramoto sushi restaurant in the hilldale area ) -- my favorite dishes here have included the soy cod, a lamb curry, and a few amazing salads.  In my experience, the oft-changing menu contains little that isn't great -- an omnivore with an open-minded palate could safely close their eyes and just start pointing.  Come with an appetite and prepare to spend a bit of change (dinner for 2 with drinks and dessert will exceed $100), and avoid the tables in the front near the door on cold days.",0,0,0jXarz-fPsDFLSfwHym1gzQ,seAX967Wk8qiVXOYjbregg,AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg,4,6/15/09,"Wandered in here looking for the restaurant and they told me to go down the street.

I got the impression this is one of the nicer restaurants in Madison, because everyone was dressed up. Except us of course. In Chicago this would be a nicer-than-average sushi restaurant, but it's not on par with Japonais. Think more along the lines of Sushi Ra if the food at Sushi Ra were a lot better.

The food was good, but to be perfectly honest, I have no business reviewing a sushi restaurant since I usually don't get any of the real shit.

The duck roll is outstanding as are the oyster shots, which are my favorite way to start dinner.  Criticism-wise, there is a bit of a problem with seating in the wintertime, as there is quite a draft coming in from the door if you sit too close to it.  Moreover, you cannot make reservations at Muramoto.  This means of course that you cannot request a table further away from the door if you want to in advance (first come first serve).  Service is just fine, ambiance is lovely.  Come with a date, not your kids and definitely not in your red UW sweatshirt.  Dress to impress; this is a spot for grownups only.  !!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!!  Downtown Muramoto has moved to an new location, which is interestingly just down the road from their old location.  This solves the drafty chill issue, there are LOTS more seats, and you can now make rezzos.  On the downswing, it's missing something of its original, uniquely Madisonian charm.  It now has vaulted ceilings, adequate lighting, and at least one waitress of questionable moral character.  Plus they have an additional location by the Hilldale Mall which is yet another step down.  I think what I'm saying is that Muramoto sold out to the man and is now no longer actually hip or trendy.  But honestly, it's still quite nice and the food is very good.

Called to make an appointment to do my gel nails, and the man on the phone was very clear about directions. Upon arriving there i can absolutely see why people might get lost. They're tucked into the back of a complex on Rose Garden lane. Easiest way to get there would be to turn and go east onto Rose Garden lane and then turn left (north) into the red brick complex. They're straight ahead of you there.   It's a nice new place, and was pretty busy when I got there, even though it was 1000 on a Saturday and they had only opened at 0900. Most people were actually there for pedis. Since I had an appointment I was seated almost right away, and they got down to removing my previous gel manicure and get a new one on me.  I do have to make a disclaimer- I hadn't always had a great experience with gel nails. I did them for my wedding and loved them, and went back to get them done after they grew out, for a bachelorette party in Vegas. The removal process was horrid- they used this thing to scrape the stuff off and it felt awful. And then I left, went shopping and literally in an HOUR had a giant chip. Of course there was no time to go back and get it fixed. It was a very disappointing experience.  But getting mine done when I was out of town had been pleasant, and my best friend said she was addicted to them. So I decided to give it a shot again.   And I'm glad I did. The removal process here was quick and painless- the gel manicure crumbled off when it came time to scrape it off, no awful sensations necessary. They had a great range of colors, and my lady even tried to recommend another color for me. (I wound up sticking with the color I wanted). The nails were beautifully done, and she did them promptly- I was in and out of the place in under an hour. I did decide to wait about a week to do a review, to see how well these puppies wear. The manicure I had prior to this chipped a bit on the thumbs within a week, which was also a bit disappointing.  A week and these nails look as good as they did when I left the salon. I'm hard on my nails too- I pound at a keyboard, and have two big, rough dogs at home. These still look great- no chips, wonderful shine.

A good thing to see with all the For Lease signs that have been cropping up lately.  If someone could translate what is yelled at patrons once they enter, it would be greatly appreciated.  I'll assume it is a greeting.  The friendly staff that helped us explained that the general restaurant experience is that of arriving, eating and then leaving to go enjoy something else, somewhere else.  The Izakaya experience is designed for you to eat, drink, socialize, etc. all under one roof.  Hence the loud and sometimes frantic atmosphere.  Pretty much a tapas menu.  After perusing the Sake menu, my wife and I settled on some Sapporo, mine in the bath-sized glass.  It wasn't that the Sake menu wasn't impressive, but my wife doesn't love it, I have limited experience with the Gekkeikan brand and I just wasn't in the mood to take a chance on a 3 oz, $15-30 sake that I may or may not like.  Maybe if I'd have been encouraged or had some sort of crash course I would have considered.  Any way, food:  In absence of a bread basket, you are given what is called thin spaghetti, coated in salt and flavoured with a spicy curry.  A little strange a different as it is like eating spicy uncooked spaghetti.    Started with the Cucumber Addiction - sliced pickled cucumber with sesame seed and oil.  A great clean-tasting starter.  All orders come out fast and furious, but staggered so as not to bung up the table too much.  The Pork Rib Kakuni was really good.  3 fall off the bone pork ribs that are slow braised and served on mashed potato with a spicy mustard for more flavour.  This was really tasty and a good portion of meat for only 3 pork ribs.  The Soy Bean Cream Crab Croquette is a mouthful.  Resembling arancini balls, but stuffed with crab, there 3 little guys are filling and have more substance to them than your average crab dish.  The Tuna Carpaccio is delicious with a savoury mixture coating the fish.  A little tricky to pick up with the chop sticks, as it is chopped rather finely, but worth the effort.  The Deep Fried Prawns are quite massive and heavy on the garlic, but the spicy sauce make 'em quite a lovely plate and pretty to look at once delivered.  As the evening progresses, more and more residents of Oakville filter in.  There is a lot of bumping and jockeying for room in this narrow little space.  Conversations can be heard from basically every table.  The fake-chested table were amazed when Barbie's shorter sister came in, no less than one month after giving birth and back to her fighting weight.  A quick cat walk, a twirl and they're sat beside us.  Yaaaaay.  This is where service fell apart.  We had one more order coming and we were contemplating another round of drinks and possibly dessert.  But with all the air-kissing going on and the place getting louder and packed, the person taking our orders came back to our table after 15-20 minutes, stating that he'd forgotten to enter our last dish.  Another 20 minutes later and the special of the night Cod we'd ordered arrived.  It was incredible and naturally buttery.  Any aggressive thoughts were forgotten instantaneously.   Food for Thought:  if you come for the special catches of the day, come early.  4 of the 6 fish specials were sold out by 7:30.  And the Blowtorch Mackerel?  It may be delicious but smells of burnt arm hair.  Maybe its just me and my wacky palette.  Hopefully the ""trendiness"" wears off in the passing months.

Warmly welcomed at the front by a nice hostess, and we're told we could even have a seat in the bar. Since we were interested in the Pirates game, it worked out, they have a few TV's in the bar for such purposes.  We ordered our drinks; Prosecco & Malbec. Both by the glass. Our server gave us big glasses of water with out drinks so A+ there.  The bread came out first and it was awesome. Perfectly warmed, large slices, crunchy crusted Italian bread that tasted like it was made in house. Served with ambient temperature butter (another pet peeve of mine is ice cold butter) so A+ The salad came out next and was the first area where we'd recommend a little change, maybe a little larger for sharing between two. But it was flavorful, cold, and dressed just right. The fresh cracked pepper added to it so overall: B Next our entrees: I had the Three-Cheese Lasagna my partner had the Gambellini Fra Diavolo (sorry if I misspelled it.) they came out at just the right temperature and at the same time. I tried a bite of his dish and the Diavolo was mild, but with a ""back-of-the-throat"" heat which is perfect. So: ""A"" for his dish. My lasagna was rather impressive, and I didn't realize the recipe was total cheese lasagna, but it was delicious. The only downside would be a personal preference of a little more herbs or spice in the cheese mixture. The tomato  sauce was slightly sweet and tasted of homemade. So well worth trying!  Overall the reason behind the 4-star review is only for the slight downsides, but again, could just be my personal preference.  I highly recommend coming here to try it out!

The ribs and pulled pork are really good, but not really great. Granted, that's really comparing to at-home bbq using a smoker. When it comes to restaurants, you will be hard pressed to find better bbq in NE Ohio. And it's definitely better than other Ohio bbq chains like Carolina BBQ and City BBQ.   Where HSW really shines is their fried chicken and Po Boy and Po Girl. The fried chicken is easily some of the best fried chicken I've ever had - crisp skin, cooked to perfect doneness. But if you go to HSW, be sure to get a Po Boy or Po Girl. What's the exact difference? I don't remember. The better one is the one with a hot sausage in a bun topped with pork shoulder, french fries, coleslaw, and french fries (I think that's the po girl). I cannot eat it with my hands, because it falls apart. If you can eat it without utensils, then give yourself 100 extra Man Points (c). Unfortunately, I dont get to make it to HSW very often, so I've not been able to try their fried fish or several other foods.  For drinks, they have soda machines and HUGs (kool aid in a tiny barel). Last time I was there, they didn't have a soda machine, so no free refills, which is a bummer  Though I love the food and their pink & blue color scheme outside, I think they only hire terrible people to work the registers. I've literally never eaten there and experienced a cashier that wasn't rude. They not only seemed to hate me on a personal level, but were offended by my audacity of ordering food there. With that being said, the cooks and individuals handing out the food have always been very sweet and friendly. Also, there was an employee my first visit there who helped me open a stuck bathroom door, and he was really great. I'm confused as to why the cashiers have been awful. Granted, I haven't been to HSW in well over a year since I moved out of state, so perhaps their cashiers are less butthurt now.  If I remember correctly, all locations are not places you want to be late and night by yourself with obvious fistfuls of cash (if ya catch my drift), so if you're an easily scared white person, go for lunch. Also, they used to only accept cash - not sure if that's changed.  If you're looking for a local restaurant and would like some soul food or bbq, I very highly recommend HSW.

It's a shame that this shiny new part of Cleveland doesn't get the traffic it deserves after the boom that was Summer 2016. Getting here is about a 10 min walk from the RTA station, but at night, when there's hardly anyone around, and your phone light is shining brighter than the streetlights... The empty buildings can be pretty eerie. Buuut, I guess I can't complain about having my pick of the reservation times during Downtown Restaurant Week.   The Burnham can be entered directly from the side of the Hilton building, and my friend and I were pretty impressed by the upscale nautical wall deco. Everything still looked as though the plastic wrap had just been taken off. We were shown in short order to our table, a half-booth ordeal. Normally I'm all about the booth tables, but our booties sank a little too deep into the plush seat and made the table an awkward height to lean your arms on. Which, if you have just above can't-take-you-ANYWHERE etiquette like me, you tend to do quite often. Anyways. We were brought some complimentary bread and olive oil while looking through our menus, but the server nearly dropped the bread on the table instead of our plates, and the bread was quite plainly not fresh. A rough start.   Our hearts and stomachs dropped a little when we saw our first appetizer (not part of the Prix Fixe menu), five tiny Garlic & Onion Beignets. This was definitely not Southern hospitality. They were pretty good, but gone too soon, including the pickle garnish. Each of us then chose different salads for the first course and were pleasantly surprised by the unique ingredients. No plain Caesar from the grab bag - mine had a crunchy mix of greens, pickles, sunchoke, and a light dressing. Main course involved a Swordfish Schnitzel for me, and a Sous Vide Fried Chicken for her. You heard right. Schnitzel and sous vide, chicken and swordfish? Did they draw these combos out of a hat? Maybe, but they work surprisingly well together - both meats were tender, the accompanying sides (radish + mashed potatoes for me) appropriately balancing. I could probably have done with less salt overall, but know that you'll be leaving full after an entree. The desserts were cute trays of Petit Fours, including cake pops and macarons. Nothing mind-boggling, but easy to pack up and eat on the go.   Like others have said, service was fairly slow. It took a while for our dishes to come and for water to be refilled even though we were one of probably five tables that evening. The staff is definitely rough around the edges compared to the establishment (I mean, have you SEEN the bathrooms? Go, just go outside across the hallway, and enjoy the gilded glory.). It's not a place you should expect to grab a quick bite - although I think I spotted a kid eating chicken tenders a few tables over.

The Sous Vide chicken was well prepared, maybe just a touch over done, and the creamy mash and broccolini were nice accompaniments. While the broccolini was a tad under-salted, the mashed potatoes were a bit over-salted so I ate them together and it was perfect. I can handle that. I wasn't however, a fan of the BBQ sauce that adorned the chicken. Thankfully, it was mostly served on the side so the dish was still a great choice.   Johnny was a very pleasant server and we worked up a nice rapport by the end. His recommendations were genuine and he steered me toward a dish that I would enjoy - one thing I appreciate in a server! His push for the featured Mitchell's Banana Pudding ice cream was a win, especially with his flexibility in swapping out the vanilla ice cream on the chocolate angel food cake dessert dish. Yum!  All in all, I think the restaurant offers good value, a fun vibe, and it's awesome that you can go for pre- or post-dinner drinks at the 32 Bar (rooftop)!  Final thing: I loved their dining chairs.

I got mine topped simply with just the special mayo mustard.  I also went, of course, with a cup of the locally brewed root beer.  I debated the growler when I saw them on the counter, but it seemed a bit pricey (I think it was $15 for the growler full of root beer).  I took my cup and dog to go, but really just sat outside at one of the tables since it was such a nice day.  I unwrapped my dog and was surprised at it's size - bigger than I expected.  This was going to be more than a snack.  I took a bite.  And instantly my brain thought, ""This doesn't taste like a hot dog.""  Then I remembered, duh, I ordered the veggie dog.  The taste was not unpleasant to my meat-loving sensibilities.  And the special mayo mustard, which I think was just mayo mixed with dijon mustard, had a nice flavor to it.

They sell their signature miniature ""slider"" sized burgers at an overpriced rate. This seems to be the selling gimmick for White Castle, luring in drunk gamblers or curious tourists to stop in.   The restaurant itself is attached to the casino of the Venetian I believe. It is located on the Strip, with a one door entry point. A long line of hungry customers fills the restaurant, although it moves rather quickly. There are only 5-6 tables, with 2 larger bar-stool type tables for seating. As you reach closer to the register, you are welcomed with a better view to the behind-the-scenes look of White Castle. Rapid hands swiftly assemble buns amongst grilled onions and juicy meat patties, exchanging between different work stations to finally end up placed in a singular order, ready for the customer.   A large glass window display showcases some of the White Castle souvenirs that are available to purchase to take home. A $10 coffee cup or a $25 T-shirt? Not for me but maybe for others.   Last, but certainly not least, was the food. If you're familiar with the case and recognition of White Castle, then eating at the actual location only provides a slightly more fresh experience than the frozen, store-bought burgers. The buns are much softer and are squishy to the touch. The taste and aroma of the grilled onions complement the meat patty. It's White Castle, there isn't much too glorify about it or expect.

If you're into small & soft burgers-- this is the place for you. Also, I really like how the cheese is always melted in the burger (that's total perfection). However, the squiggly fries were ""eh."" Same with the chicken rings-- I could pass on both and stick with the CHEESEBURGERS. Oh, and be sure to ask for the sauces with your burgers-- it definitely makes for an exciting twist. Between the other burger spots, I would choose this place because it's one of those, hashtag cheap eats -- and bragging rights of ""OMG, I ate 10 burgers!""  Service:  It was alright. Nothing to complain about.  TLDR: This place is great for cheap burgers-- comparable to McDonalds, but better. in flavor and MELTED CHEESE! Burgers are small, so order A LOT (5-6 per person).

February 2013 onwards we can look forward to a Warhol series.   The gallery itself is pretty compact, the audio aids provided are quite easy to use and the gallery doesn't seem to get too crowded to allow enjoyment of these exquisite works.

Do the artists showcased play a factor?  Granted, I took advantage of a ""Free Admission"" day, so I didn't pay the requisite $15 dollars.  It's only 4 rooms, so it took less than an hour to complete, but I did see some beautiful pieces there from the ""Figuratively Speaking: A Survey of the Human Form"" exhibit.  Some from Lichtenstein, and Nara, and Picasso, Degas, and Renoir.  Certainly, viewing the works of these artists has to be worth something.

It is simply too expensive for many people out there, and a lot of them will feel cheated for the money.  At a stout $15 per person, it can seem a bit pricey, especially with places like the Met at NYC can be entered for a mere $5.

I have seen every show at the gallery since the first show. My first stop in Vegas is this gallery, now that the Guggenheim branch at the Venetian is closed.  I do, however, miss the voice overs of the likes of Jeremy Irons on the audio tours that the Guggenheim used to feature.  There is nothing like well-written art scholarship read with passionate restraint.   One of my particular favorite shows was on Early Modernism in America, from the vital beginnings of Post World War II art in New York, and featured an array of works that must have been hard to locate and assemble.  The exhibitions here, although limited because of the gallery size, are focused and sophisticated.  I do use either the teacher, or local discount for admission, so it reduces the price.  However, as an art history teacher, I have had to buy museum memberships in order to see large shows at major museums, not to mention the added costs of parking and transportation to reach destination cities.   This small, easily accessible gallery is ideal.  This gallery also accomplishes the egalitarian task of displaying work to everyone, not just the art lover who takes the time to visit a museum. These shows are well worth the price of admission for an hour or so in the company of cultural artifacts that represent the highest aspirations of mankind.  The book store also has some unique, scholarly books that feature the work shown in the gallery, so a visit there after the show is always rewarding.",1,0,1UaAX9nU5ivwRftl1YBV2dg,1IAuZhwpbGl8jwN2DTkh-w,#NAME?,4,2/13/16,"The works of Picasso are impressive and very profound. We arrived 10 minutes before their last tour. As soon as we walked we rushed to view all of his art because they were closing soon. Make sure you don't wear a coat to the gallery because it's humid. I had a pleasant night alongside my best friend, we enjoyed seeing a variety of his work and the metamorphosis his work went through, throughout the years. I find his work to stir many emotions and constant battle though surrealism and the steady depth in the color and canvas. I am the happiest girl on earth to see his work before they left to his family estate in Spain. For my first time viewing his work and standing to it so closely, I felt as if I was at his house, and Picasso opens the door to his villa and welcomes us delighted to show us his passion and inspiration. 43 years later he will forever be one of the greatest. I do have one small complain and that was the woman who worked inside the gallery of who gave us attitude thought the entire exhibition, she constantly displayed her negativity and couldn't stop staring. I hope next time she doesn't interrupt us, she was rude.",2,1,1JtIj2QzqUTWWpbYOFnyZ0w,PePWIBvMyZ529fhrJLzgJQ,#NAME?,4,6/6/13,"Saw the Andy Warhol Wild West Exhibit here and it was so cool!  Ive seen his other work at the MoMA in NYC and those were also rad. The work shown here, however, is probably not as popular to the public as those shown at MoMA.  We were given an audio device that you hold up to your ear and it plays information regarding the artwork.  It was nice to hear the history behind the art and really made me appreciate it more.  My favorite  were the polaroids that Andy Warhol took of celebrities and of himself - so perfectly imperfect. Very small gallery though.

I was actually feeling like a little kid again as we were on our way walking up the strip looking for this place! A special adventure! I was so happy to finally eat at a White Castle! To me, this was the first mini burger I have ever had, so it was unique.   I ordered the 20 pack of sliders and 2 regular fries combo pack. $25.99 before tax. Sitting down and laying them all out for my girlfriend and I people thought it was all to myself since she was in the restroom. I laughed and said no, I could have eaten all of it, but not today :P The burgers tasted exactly like the frozen ones, just a bit fresher. Not too surprising, would give them a 3 stars. But the extra star for me was the service and overall experience I got from finally eating at this place! Highly recommended for a quick burger bite!

They taste exactly like the ones you find at the frozen section of your local grocery store/7-11 (after they've been defrosted/heated, of course).... even though they're supposed to be *somewhat* more fresh when prepared right away. Really, it's not any different, so I wouldn't make it a point to stop by White Castle when in Vegas, unless you want to try their other items like chicken rings, fries, etc.  If you're planning a visit anyway, the deep fried onion petals are a must as a choice of side! Super crunchy and delicious. I don't know about you, but I always felt awkward biting into an onion ""ring"". These are so much more fun to eat! Just pop those little suckers right into your mouth. I went with somebody who has tried it in New York, and apparently this location doesn't offer everything from the original menu.  The mere thought of horseradish makes me cringe and shiver for irrational reasons, so if you and I share that intense disgust for it, stay away from the zesty zing dipping sauce. Had it by accident without knowing what it was. Blarrrggh!   I'm not an active environmentalist, but I don't litter and am aware of other issues relating to the matter, so it did sort of break my heart to toss out so much cardboard boxes that only served as brief housing for such dinky sliders :( But I suppose that it's because they are very delicate, and typical wrappers would've squashed them.",27,24,27vrNNSPUXX1OCTqShfjImvw,UyRewWXlNV59c21D52BPCw,dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,4,7/27/15,"I was surprised to find that this East Coast chain had found its way to the Las Vegas Strip.

Do not come here expecting to have a burger your way with 86 options to choose from, you can venture down the strip if you want to spend 40 bucks on a gourmet burger. This place is serious business here, they have A LOT of employees working in assembly lines preparing burgers, refilling soda machines, stocking up on ketchup, cleaning up as soon as a vacant seat is available, calling out numbers with video screen assistance like the DMV, organized chaos at its finest. The line stayed long, it moved quickly, and the staff was great. I got the cheese sliders, and being a cheese lover I do not think I would enjoy burger as much without it.

Just keep in mind, they're NO comparison to a normal burger like In-n-Out.  So believe me, I'm McLovin' all the negative reviews.  Yes they're cute tiny little burgers and can be eaten in four bites.  But that soft steamy bun with a little bit of chopped onions, pickles, and melted cheese (or without) are just the best!  Not as healthy as a four start chain Habit Burger, or as beefy as Five Guys, but more of an ""if I had a fast food burger choice"" of a burger chain;  I'd choose the Dub C!  I mean, they made a movie out of it!  Plus I grew up with them in St. Louis, so it's a personal choice!
